Welcome to The Everything Emulator
(side note: it is not actually _everything_)

This is not an emulator itself. The purpose of this app is to act as a hub for various emulators. This eliminates the need to remember the names of various emulators, and instead gives a central access point.
In addition to housing emulators, this will also provide a list of all of your games that you have, with the ability to easily search through them. You can just click a game to open it from here. 

Please note, it is primarily Nintendo Game Emulators supported, as that is my preference.

The main value is for convenience, but it also acts as an easy way to setup emulators in your living room. Rather than having several consoles out, you can simply install this to a laptop, and put it up on the screen to allow easy access to all of your games.

The technologies used in this project are EEL, a python library for developing website like apps, and Retroarch's database of ROM hashes. The database is local, around 30GB in space, in order to make the app not rely on wifi, as well as run faster as it doesn't need to wait on potentially dozens of API calls to go through.
