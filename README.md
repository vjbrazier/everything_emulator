Welcome to The Everything Emulator
(side note: it is not actually _everything_)

The purpose of this is not to emulate every single emulator out there. It is a far cry from that, and it actually does not do any emulation itself.
Do not look to this as though it is an alterntive to RetroArch or similar.

The purpose of this is to create a singular application that acts as a "hub" for all of your emulators and games.
What emulators are available is limited it is mostly Nintendo Stuff with a few others sprinkled in.

The way the games load is that it relies on a database from RetroArch of hashes for the games that contain all the data on them. 
The database is local to prevent the need for API calls. I had enough storage to hold this for myself which is what led to this decision.
